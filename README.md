This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakubfalowski/analizerpilkarski
```

After change directory to folder statistic-app
```bash
cd statistic-app
```
To install node-modules
```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To run cypress tests (type when server is starting)
```bash
npx cypress run
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
